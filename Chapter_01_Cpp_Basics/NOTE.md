# 1.1 Statements and the structure of a program

## Statements
- A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do. 
- A ***statement*** is a type of instruction that causes the program to _perform some action_.
- The smallest independent unit of computation in the C++ language.
- In general, a line that ends in a semicolon is mostly a statement.

[Different Types of statements]
1. Declaration statements
2. Jump statements
3. Expression statements
4. Compound statements
5. Selection statements (conditionals)
6. Iteration statements (loops)
7. Try blocks

## Function
- A collection of statements that executes sequentially.
- Every C++ program must have a special function named ***main***. When the program is run, the statements inside of _main_ are executed in sequential order.
